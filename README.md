# pandas-challenge

This is the challenge of module 4, to carry out this challenge I have used the material given in the Bootcamp classes, ChatGPT, the class tutorials and the suggestions given in Slack.

## Instructions

Using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook, create a report that includes the following data. Your report must include a written description of at least two observable trends based on the data.

## District Summary

Perform the necessary calculations and then create a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics in a DataFrame.
Include the following:

1) Total number of unique schools

2) Total students

3) Total budget

4) Average math score

5) Average reading score

6) % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)

7) % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)

8) % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

## School Summary

Perform the necessary calculations and then create a DataFrame that summarizes key metrics about each school.
Include the following:

1) School name

2) School type

3) Total students

4) Total school budget

5) Per student budget

6) Average math score

7) Average reading score

8) % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)

9) % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)

10) % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

## Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)

Sort the schools by % Overall Passing in descending order and display the top 5 rows.
Save the results in a DataFrame called "top_schools".

## Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)

Sort the schools by % Overall Passing in ascending order and display the top 5 rows.
Save the results in a DataFrame called "bottom_schools".

## Math Scores by Grade

Perform the necessary calculations to create a DataFrame that lists the average math score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

## Reading Scores by Grade

Create a DataFrame that lists the average reading score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

## Scores by School Spending

Create a table that breaks down school performance based on average spending ranges (per student).

## Scores by School Size

Create a DataFrame called size_summary that breaks down school performance based on school size (small, medium, or large).

## Scores by School Type

Use the per_school_summary DataFrame from the previous step to create a new DataFrame called type_summary.
This new DataFrame should show school performance based on the "School Type".
